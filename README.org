#+TITLE: Adversarial Transformation Network(ATN)

* Introduction

  A simple implement of an Adversarial Autoencoding ATN(AAE ATN) proposed in [[https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.09387][Adversarial Transformation Networks: Learning to Generate Adversarial Examples]]


* Usage

  You can test with my trained model:

  #+BEGIN_SRC shell
  python atn.py
  #+END_SRC

  If you want to train by yourself:
  #+BEGIN_SRC shell
  python atn.py --train
  #+END_SRC

* Result

  Here are some visualized samples:

  Before attack, the accuracy of the target cnn network is ~0.9902~, and it becomes ~0.4756~ after attack.

  The result is not good enough, so ~WELCOME CONTRIBUTION !!!~
